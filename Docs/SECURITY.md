# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We will address security issues against the current release and 2 releases back.  In some cases we may address 
an issue by recommending an upgrade to the current release and deprecating an older release. 

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security issue please send a private message to mike.dickson@utopiaskye.com describing the issue. 
We will respond with confirmation and a timeline for how we will respond to the issue.  We may not choose to make
security issues public until a suitable fix has been developed.
